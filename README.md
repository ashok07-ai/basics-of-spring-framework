# Core Concepts of Spring Framework | Java Web Development

## Coupling
Coupling refers to how closely connected different components or systems are.

---

## Tight Coupling
Tight coupling describes a scenario where software components are **highly dependent** on each other. This can make the code difficult to maintain, test, or modify because changes in one class often require changes in others.

---

## Loose Coupling
Loose coupling describes how a scenario where software components are **less dependent** on each other. This improves **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**, as changes in one class have minimal impact on others.

### How to Achieve Loose Coupling:
- Use **interfaces**
- Applying **abstraction**
- Implementing **dependency injection**
